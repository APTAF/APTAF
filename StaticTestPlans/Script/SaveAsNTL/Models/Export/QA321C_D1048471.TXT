  Model Name:       QA321C                                                      
  Model Version:    12.02.00.05                                                 
  Program Version:  12.02.00.12

  ASME B31J tees that are skewed off the global axes may not produce the        
  correct analysis results due to a previous program defect #1048471.           
  Please refer to the published defect report for more details,                 
  mitigation conditions, and instructions. To assist in the screening of        
  this model for any potential impact by this defect, the program has           
  examined the model database and has found that the results for the            
  model may be incorrect for the following ASME B31J tees and should be         
  re-computed using this program version.                                       
  After saving this model or running any analysis in this version or            
  later commercial release versions, this screening will no longer be           
  performed.
