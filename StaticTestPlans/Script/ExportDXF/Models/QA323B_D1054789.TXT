  ASME VIII-1, ASME VIII-2, and ASME III Appendix XI flanges do not             
  consider corrosion allowance due to a previous program defect                 
  #1054789. Please refer to the published defect report for more                
  details, mitigation conditions and instructions. To assist in the             
  screening of this model for any potential impact by this defect,              
  program has examined the model database and has found that the Flange         
  Check stresses for the flanges reported below should be re-computed           
  using this program version.                                                   
  After saving this model or running any analysis in this version or            
  later commercial release versions, this screening will no longer be           
  performed.
